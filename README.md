## Datastore Notes for Google App Engineâ„¢

I find that oftentimes I want to annotate records in Datastore viewers, sort of as a way to leave notes for myself. Since no one does this, I wrote a Chrome Extension that adds a notes field to each record in the datastore.

To annotate a record, just simply enter some text in the textbox, and it auto-saves.
